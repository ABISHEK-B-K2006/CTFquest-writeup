BOOT2ROOT WRITEUP BY ABI
Challenge 1: Simplistic
Category: Boot2Root / Privilege Escalation
Overview
The objective was to gain full root access on a Linux system that exposed no external network services. The challenge focused on boot-level misconfiguration rather than remote exploitation.

Step 1 — Enumeration
Network scanning revealed no open ports.
This indicated the attack surface was local, not network-based.

Step 2 — Exploitation
The system allowed access to recovery mode without authentication.
A root shell was obtained via recovery options.
The filesystem was remounted as writable:
mount -o remount,rw /
Step 3 — Flag Retrieval
cat /root/root.flag

Flag:
SECE{r00t_v14_su1d_f1nd}

Conclusion:
Unrestricted recovery mode access leads to instant root compromise.


Challenge 2: CyberSync
Category: Boot2Root / Privilege Escalation
Overview
This challenge simulated a system with no exposed services, requiring local access. The underlying lesson revolved around insecure automation design, particularly Python execution trust.

Step 1 — Enumeration
Network scan showed all ports filtered.
Console access confirmed recovery mode was enabled.

Step 2 — Exploitation
Recovery mode was used to access a root shell.
Filesystem remounted as writable:
mount -o remount,rw /

Step 3 — Discovery
The root flag message indicated a Python library hijacking vulnerability.
The challenge demonstrated how Python automation trusting local libraries can be dangerous, even though no active hijack was performed.

Step 4 — Flag Retrieval
cat /root/root.txt
Flag:
SECE{Pyth0n_L1b_H1j4ck_1s_P0w3rful!}

Conclusion:
Improper trust in Python execution environments can lead to library hijacking attacks.



Challenge 3: Silent Trust

Category: Boot2Root / Trust Exploitation

Overview
The system intentionally blocked SSH and console login, forcing analysis of implicit trust relationships in automation and CI artifacts.

Step 1 — Enumeration
SSH service existed but denied authentication.
Cron jobs and systemd services appeared clean.
User devops existed but was non-interactive.
 
Step 2 — Discovery
CI-related files were found under:
/home/devops/.cache/.ci/
A user flag confirmed exploitation direction.

Step 3 — Root Access
Boot analysis allowed inspection of trusted execution paths.
Root implicitly trusted CI artifacts owned by a non-login user.

Step 4 — Flags
User Flag:
SECE{trust_is_the_first_vulnerability}
Root Flag:
SECE{capabilities_are_stronger_than_passwords}

Conclusion:
Automation and CI/CD pipelines introduce silent trust paths that can be abused without direct user login.

Challenge 4: Chain of Trust
Category: Boot2Root / Trust Chaining

Overview
This challenge required chaining multiple small misconfigurations rather than exploiting a single vulnerability.

Step 1 — Enumeration
No network services were exposed.
No sudo, SUID, or direct privilege escalation paths were available.

Step 2 — Exploitation
Trust assumptions across execution contexts were analyzed.
Multiple weak trust boundaries were chained together to achieve root access.

Step 3 — Flag Retrieval
cat /root/flag.txt

Flag:
SECE{ch41n_th3_m1st4k3s_n0t_c0mm4nds}

Conclusion:
Real-world compromises often occur due to chained assumptions, not obvious vulnerabilities.

Challenge 5: Shadow Backup

Category: Boot2Root / Privilege Delegation

Overview:
The system simulated improper privilege delegation within backup mechanisms, leading to full root compromise.

Step 1 — Enumeration
Backup-related files were discovered under:
/root/flag/
Misconfigured sudo secure_path behavior was identified.

Step 2 — Exploitation
Trusted backup execution paths allowed access to privileged files.
Root filesystem inspection revealed the final flag.

Step 3 — Flag Retrieval
cat /root/flag/root.txt

Flag:
SECE{sudo_secure_path_is_not_your_friend}


Challenge 6: Tarpit
Category: Boot2Root / Privilege Escalation
Overview
The objective was to gain full root access on a Linux system that exposed no external network services. The challenge focused on boot-level misconfiguration rather than remote exploitation.

Step 1 — Enumeration
Network scanning revealed no open ports.
This indicated the attack surface was local, not network-based.

Step 2 — Exploitation
The system allowed access to recovery mode without authentication.
A root shell was obtained via recovery options.
The filesystem was remounted as writable:
mount -o remount,rw /

Step 3 — Flag Retrieval
ls /root
there is flag.txt
cat flag.txt

Flag:
SECE{b2r_sudo_tar_pwned}

Conclusion:
Unrestricted recovery mode access leads to instant root compromise.
